# My Defense Against People Calling Me Immoral for Not Having a Wife or Children 

*An extended personal essay drawing on philosophy, science, and lived experience* 

---

## Introduction 

For more than four decades I have lived a life that runs counter to the expectations of the majority. I have never entered a long‑term romantic partnership, and I have consciously chosen not to become a parent. Friends, relatives, and even strangers sometimes label me "immoral", as if the very act of refusing a wife and children violates some universal moral law. In this essay I lay out, in a systematic way, why that accusation is mistaken. I will examine the health, psychological, and practical dimensions of my choice; I will confront the common moral arguments that invoke duty to family, duty to society, or duty to a divine creator; and I will show how a consistent set of premises leads inevitably to the conclusion that my lifestyle is morally permissible - even commendable. 

All the material presented here derives from publicly available research, well‑known philosophical arguments, and my own observations.

## I. The Personal Health Argument 

### A. Empirical evidence on marital status and health 

Large epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that marital status correlates with certain health outcomes. For example, a meta‑analysis of over 300,000 participants found that married individuals, on average, enjoy a modest mortality advantage compared to those who are single (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). However, the same research also emphasizes that *the quality* of the marital relationship matters far more than the mere fact of being married. High‑conflict or abusive marriages are associated with *greater* health risks than remaining single. 

My own experience aligns with this nuanced picture. I stay fit, well within the target BMI for my age; maintain a diet low in processed foods, and abstain from smoking and drug/alcohol use. Over the past decades I have never suffered the chronic illnesses that afflict many of my married peers; many of whom struggle with things like obesity, cardiovascular disease or alcohol dependence. The data therefore do not support a blanket claim that single life is inherently unhealthy; rather, they demonstrate that a *healthy* lifestyle - exercise, nutrition, sleep, stress management - can more than offset any statistical advantage a marriage might confer. 

### B. The "burden" calculus 

When people argue that marriage and parenthood are natural duties, they often frame the obligations as *burdens* that are ultimately rewarding. I reject that premise on two grounds. First, the term "burden" presupposes a cost‑benefit analysis in which the costs outweigh the benefits **for me personally**. I have examined those costs and benefits objectively: the time, emotional labor, and financial outlays required to maintain a household and raise children would inevitably subtract from the hours I currently devote to the pursuits that give my life meaning - science, research, sports, friendships. In my case the "burden" is not a temporary inconvenience; it is a permanent reallocation of scarce resources that would diminish, not enhance, my overall well‑being.

## II. The Moral Irrelevance of Procreation 

### A. Antinatalism and the problem of gratuitous suffering 

A central philosophical strand - **antinatalism** - holds that bringing a new sentient being into existence is morally questionable because it inevitably exposes that being to suffering that could have been avoided. The world is replete with random, often pointless pain: child cancer, earthquakes and tsunamis, wars, the daily miseries that no one can predict or control... If a creator's purpose were to maximize happiness, the existence of such pervasive, unpreventable suffering appears incompatible with a benevolent design. 

From this perspective, the moral question is not "*Should* I have children?" but "*Is* it permissible to create a life that will inevitably encounter unpreventable harm?" My answer is a firm "no." Since I cannot guarantee a future free of the kinds of arbitrary tragedies that define much of human existence, I deem it irresponsible to bring another consciousness into that milieu. The moral weight of *preventing* potential suffering outweighs any speculative benefits a child might enjoy. 

### B. The "supernatural selection" critique 

Some theodicies attempt to salvage a divine purpose by arguing that suffering is a necessary filter - a "supernatural selection" that weeds out the morally weak and refines the virtuous, gathering the result in Heaven. If this were true, the creator could simply instantiate fully formed, perfectly moral beings in the first place - without subjecting them to the random pains of this life, ranging from viruses and flesh-eating bacteria to cheating spouses and sick offspring... The claim that a deity *must* employ a painful apprenticeship to produce good people therefore appears gratuitously cruel. I see no moral justification for imposing a lottery of suffering on an innocent individual, especially when the same virtues could be cultivated in a world that does not require extreme hardship. 

Thus, whether one assumes a deity exists or not, the argument that procreation serves a higher, inscrutable purpose fails to overcome the prima facie moral case against creating new life - in a world of random, often needless suffering.

## III. The Societal and Demographic Argument 

### A. The myth of a "genetic duty" 

A common societal narrative suggests that individuals have a duty to reproduce because the continuation of the human species depends on each person's contribution. This argument implicitly assumes that *any* offspring is a net positive for humanity. Is it?

My personal decision not to have children does not meaningfully threaten demographic stability. The overall birth rate is determined by millions of individuals; the choice of a single, highly capable adult to remain child‑free has negligible impact on the macro‑level population trajectory. Moreover, the notion that my "high‑intelligence" genes must be passed-on, presupposes a genetic essentialism that modern genetics has largely discredited. Human traits are polygenic, heavily influenced by environment, and do not map cleanly onto a single "intelligence" locus that could be lost by opting out of reproduction. 

Not all men are made to reproduce. Mother Nature created the worker bee; her and people like me share a common trait - we build the hive, we create the civilisation that others live in. We don't reproduce.

### B. The "no‑harm" principle 

If I were to adopt a consequentialist stance, the relevant question would be whether my childlessness causes net harm to society. The answer is negative: my continued contributions as a scientist, engineer, colleague and mentor provide tangible benefits and research breakthroughs. I would not be able to achieve any of that - not to the level I did - if I had to juggle married life.

If there is harm in my choice, it is only in the sense of "missed opportunity"; but that applies equally well to the counter-choice. As an argument it falls on its face, because it's impossible to know what kind of a father and husband I'd be. My gut tells me I'd be abysmal; every fibre of my being tells me "I chose wisely". In the decades I've lived, I've met hundreds of married people. You have, too - tell me: have you NEVER seen someone verbally (or non-verbally) abuse his wife and/or children, and thought to yourself: "that man should have never married".

I am that man. Not because I'd abuse anyone; but because I know with absolute certainty, that it's a role I don't fit in.

## IV. The Autonomy and Individual‑Rights Perspective 

### A. Bodily autonomy as a foundational right 

In liberal political philosophy, bodily autonomy is a cornerstone principle. Individuals possess the right to make decisions about their own bodies, relationships, and reproductive choices, provided they do not infringe upon the rights of others. My decision to remain single and child‑free is an exercise of that autonomy. It does not impose any direct harm on anyone; rather, it reflects a personal assessment of what constitutes a flourishing life for me. 

### B. The limits of external moral judgments 

Moral judgments that arise from cultural expectations - such as "you must marry and have children" - are often rooted in tradition rather than rational argument. While communal norms can foster social cohesion, they cannot override an individual's right to self‑determination when the individual's actions are non‑harmful. To label my lifestyle immoral simply because it diverges from the majority's path is to mistake descriptive prevalence for prescriptive morality.

## V. Addressing the "Sex" Objection 

### A. The role of sexual desire in human life 

Critics sometimes argue that a life without a partner neglects a fundamental human need: sexual intimacy. Evolutionary biology does recognize sexual desire as a driver of reproduction, but it also acknowledges that sexual expression can take many forms: solitary, consensual, and non‑reproductive. The existence of a strong sexual drive does not, in itself, entail a moral duty to seek a partner. 

### B. The distinction between *need* and *desire* 

A *need* is a requirement for survival or basic well‑being; a *desire* is a preference that can be satisfied in multiple ways. Sexual desire is a *desire*, not a need. I am able to satisfy it through means that do not involve another person, thereby preserving my autonomy and avoiding the relational burdens I have deliberately rejected.

### C. The broader social impact 

The concern that a solitary sexual life might contribute to societal dysfunction hinges on the assumption that such behavior is inherently exploitative or damaging to others. That kind of claim doesn't withstand scrutiny. There are plenty of people involved in sex work that are clear in their communication about it; and they indicate they chose their profession freely; legal, consensual acts performed between adults, not involving coercion of any kind. The moral evaluation, therefore, should focus on the presence or absence of exploitation - nothing else.

## VI. Synthesis: The Coherence of My Moral Position 

All the strands above converge on a single, coherent conclusion: my decision to remain unmarried and child‑free is morally permissible.

1. **Health** – My lifestyle, grounded in disciplined exercise and nutrition, yields measurable physical benefits that outweigh any statistical health advantage attributed to marriage. 
2. **Burden analysis** – The costs - time, emotional labor, financial strain - required for a partnership and parenthood would diminish, not enhance, my overall well‑being. 
3. **Antinatalist reasoning** – Introducing a new conscious being into a world of unavoidable suffering is, for me, an unjustifiable risk that fails to meet my chosen moral thresholds. 
4. **Theological critique** – The supposed divine purpose that mandates procreation collapses under the weight of random suffering, and the availability of non‑painful alternatives to an all-powerful creator: the instant creation of the "chosen" people in Heaven in the first place. Arguing that this is impossible contradicts the supposed all-powerful nature of said deity.
5. **Demographic impact** – My personal childlessness does not threaten societal stability; my contributions as a professional and citizen provide compensatory social value. 
6. **Autonomy** – The right to determine the course of my own life, absent harm to others, is a fundamental ethical principle that overrides cultural expectations. 
7. **Sexual desire** – My desire is satisfied in a manner that does not infringe upon anyone else's rights, thereby neutralizing any moral claim that I must seek a partner. 

When each premise is examined individually and collectively, the accusation of immorality loses its footing. Moral condemnation presupposes that I have violated a universal duty or inflicted harm; neither is the case.

## VII. Anticipating Counter‑Arguments 

### A. "You are selfish." 

The charge of selfishness conflates self‑interest with moral wrongdoing. Ethical theories from Aristotle's virtue ethics to contemporary liberalism recognize the legitimacy of self‑care and personal fulfillment, provided they do not come at the expense of others. 

### B. "Future generations need you." 

The notion that a single individual's reproductive decision carries existential weight for humanity is a rhetorical device, not a demographic fact. Global population trends are driven by macro‑level forces; the choice of one healthy, productive adult to remain child‑free does not jeopardize the continuation of the species. 

### C. "You are denying the value of love." 

Love, in its many forms, is not limited to romantic partnership. I experience deep affection for friends, family, and the world of ideas that drives my scientific work. The argument that only marriage can embody love is a cultural bias, not a universal truth.

## VIII. Conclusion 

The accusation that I am immoral for refusing a wife and children rests on a series of unexamined assumptions: that marriage is a universal good, that procreation is a moral duty, that a deity's will must be obeyed, that sexual desire can only be fulfilled through partnership. By scrutinizing each assumption - through empirical health data, philosophical analysis of suffering, demographic realities, and a firm commitment to personal autonomy - I have shown that none of them obligates me to conform to the conventional life script. 

My life, as it stands, is a product of intentional choices that maximize health and intellectual fulfillment, while minimizing unnecessary harm. It is a life that respects both my own well‑being and the well‑being of others. To label such a life immoral is to replace rational moral reasoning with cultural conformity. I therefore invite anyone who wishes to judge my choices to first examine the premises on which their judgments are based, and to recognize that morality, at its core, is a matter of reasoned reflection - not of tradition alone.
